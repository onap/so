      "message": "Here\u0027s my thought process:\n1. I\u0027m not aware that the plugin vnf adapter is being used (at the moment) except by the multicloud plugin - so absence of the cloud_site entry defaulting to using multicloud seemed ok.  (the regular openstack-adapter shouldn\u0027t be affected)\n2. If there \u0027are\u0027 other plugin adapters being utilized, they can still use the records in the cloud_site table.\n\nBasically, it seems to me that Multicloud plugin adapter doesn\u0027t really \u0027need\u0027 records in the cloud_site table to work - so tried it out in code to see what it would look like.  If needs be, then I can change the patch to expect a cloud_site record.",
