      "message": "Lukasz, that is ok. There was initial assumption to use vf-module-id as a release-name in the k8s-plugin request but we realized it is wrong assumption as release-name attribute cannot start with a cipher. In consequence we have changed the way of taking the value of release name and hence this is not vf-module-id the name of the attribute was changed, however the json name of the parameter before, and after the change is still the same - \"release-name\".",
