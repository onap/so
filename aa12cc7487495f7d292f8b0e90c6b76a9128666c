However as per Steve\u0027s comments on patch 4, DB changes are not recommended and to have backward compatibility of the code,  instead of editing the existing flow in orchestration flow table, I am reading the data from orchestration table and appending custom flows to the list based on the SkipConfig flag retrieved from TOSCA.",

I gave you the choice of solution.  You could insert it to the database then add additional logic to \"remove\" it from execution if the flag is not set.  Either way you have to do dynamic manipulation of the list with your current design choice.",
