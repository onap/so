/**
 * This interface defines a common API for template-based cloud deployments.
 * The methods here should be adaptable for Openstack (Heat), Cloudify (TOSCA),
 * Aria (TOSCA), Multi-VIM (TBD), and others (e.g. Azure Resource Manager).
 * 
 * The deployed instances are referred to here as Virtual Deployment Units (VDUs).
 * The package of templates that define a give VDU is referred to as its blueprint.
 * 
 * Template-based orchestrators all follow a similar template/blueprint model.
 * - One main template that is the top level definition
 * - Optional nested templates referenced/included by the main template
 * - Optional files attached to the template package, typically containing
 *   configuration files, install scripts, orchestration scripts, etc.
 *   
 * The main template also defines the required inputs for creating a new instance,
 * and output values exposed by successfully deployed instances.  Inputs and outputs
 * may include simple or complex (JSON) data types.
 *   
 * Each implementation of this interface is expected to understand the MSO CloudConfig
 * to obtain the credentials for its sub-orchestrator and the targeted cloud.
 * The sub-orchestrator may have different credentials from the cloud (e.g. an Aria 
 * instance in front of an Openstack cloud) or they may be the same (e.g. Heat)

     * The instantiateVdu interface deploys a new VDU instance from a blueprint package.

     * files are expressed as byte arrays, though only text files are expected from ASDC.
     * 
     * For some VIMs, this may be a single command (e.g. Heat -> create stack) or may
     * require a series of API calls (e.g. Cloudify -> upload blueprint, create deployment,
     * execute install workflow).  These details are hidden within the implementation.

     * method is expected to back out the attempt, leaving the cloud in its previous state.

     * required parameters for the given template with no extra parameters.

     * @param vduBlueprint Object containing the collection of templates and files that comprise
     * 		the blueprint for this VDU.

     * 		primarily for Heat, though ASDC may create a similar file for other orchestrators.
