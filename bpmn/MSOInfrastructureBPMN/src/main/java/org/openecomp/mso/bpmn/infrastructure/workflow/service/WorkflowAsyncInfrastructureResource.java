/**
 * 
 * @version 1.0
 * Asynchronous Workflow processing using JAX RS RESTeasy implementation
 * Both Synchronous and Asynchronous BPMN process can benefit from this implementation since the workflow gets executed in the background
 * and the server thread is freed up, server scales better to process more incoming requests
 * 
 * Usage: For synchronous process, when you are ready to send the response invoke the callback to write the response
 * For asynchronous process - the activity may send a acknowledgement response and then proceed further on executing the process
