      "message": "Hi Steve,\nThe method I changed assumes to choose NorthBoundRequest object by: ACTION, REQUEST_SCOPE, IS_ALACARTE and CLOUD_OWNER. \nBut to this query there is additional condition: where serviceType\u003d\"*\". \n\nSo the first question is why serviceType is taking into account here?. There is another method that takes serviceType additionally, and it is named getNorthBoundRequestByActionAndIsALaCarteAndRequestScopeAndCloudOwnerAndServiceType. \n\nSecondly, why asterix \"*\"? I can not see any place in the code that would set this field as \"*\". \nI think that maybe somebody thought that \"*\" means \"any\" here, but it does not work that way in sql.\n\nplease respond Steve",
