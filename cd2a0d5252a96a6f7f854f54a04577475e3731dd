      "message": "To be honest I still don\u0027t understand why you need to use this class if you could add this implementation to GenericCDSProcessingDE which is focused solely on PNFs. Now you need to add more string-based \u0027cases\u0027 and \u0027ifs\u0027 which are later very difficult to find by other developers. I know how much time it took me to find all those VNF/PNF related implementations hidden all over the SO code in similar \u0027cases\u0027 and \u0027ifs\u0027. Anyway this is just a comment, if you feel this better suits your needs then I won\u0027t argue here.",
