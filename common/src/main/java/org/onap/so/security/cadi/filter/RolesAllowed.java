 *         Similar to Java EE's Spec from Annotations 1.1, 2.8
 *
 *         That Spec, however, was geared towards being able to route calls to Methods on Objects, and thus needed a
 *         more refined sense of permissions hierarchy. The same mechanism, however, can easily be achieved on single
 *         Servlet/Handlers in POJOs like Jetty by simply adding the Roles Allowed in a similar Annotation
