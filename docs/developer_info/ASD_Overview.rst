ASD Architecture
=======================

ASD Overview
-------------
Application Service Descriptor (ASD) is a deployment descriptor for cloud native application/functions. It seeks to provide deployment using the minimum information needed by the orchestrator.
The CSAR package adheres to ETSI SOL004.
ASD minimizes duplication whilst leveraging the management capabilities of the Kubernets platfor. It provides a clear separation between high level orchestration and cloud native application deployment.
