Building Block Understanding
============================

UNDERSTANDING BUILDING BLOCKS USING MACRO FLOW
----------------------------------------------
There are basically 2 flows - macro , a la carte.

**In a la carte:**

    We manually will initiate each step for a process.

**In macro:**

  The whole flow happens at a single click like if we want to create a service.
  The flow will itself look whether there are vnfs, pnfs or networks in the
  service and it will be created and activated in the flow also.Thus these
  independent tasks like if vnf is present, then assign create and activate vnf
  are all taken up as individual building blocks and are only called on need
  basis.
  Each and every request will reach to the api handler first.

API HANDLER( ServiceInstances.java )
------------------------------------



# 1. Rest call reaching SO Api handler with the input json

    According to the below path it is mapped to the createServiceInstance
    function in ServiceInstances file.

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data @serviceinstance.json -u mso_admin:password1$ http://localhost:8080/onap/so/infra/serviceInstantiation/v7/serviceInstances.

# 2. Herein a unique requestid is generated corresponding to every request, and
is checked whether that particular requestid exists in request db (Happens in
createServiceInstance in ServiceInstances).

    a. **http://request-db-adapter:8083/infraActiveRequests/requestid** (GET), which will return a 404 if not exists.

    b. CreateInstance is set to the action variable. Here the request scope is
       set to service from the inputjson - modelType.


# 3. Running local validations on input json.

# 4. create InfraActiveRequests, to store request details in request db adapter
and as a payload to bpmn.

    a) A new InfraActiveRequests object is created. And all the necessary
       information from the input is set to it.

    b) Retrieving productFamilyName from the input json to put into requests db. **http://aai/servicedesigncreation/services/service/{productfamilyid}** (GET), which will return a 404 if not exists in aai. If service exists, then that service's serviceDescritiption is set as productfamilyName.

    c) **http://aai/cloudinfrastructure/cloudregions/cloudregion/cloudowner/{lcpCloudRegionId}/tenants/tenant/{tenantId}** (GET), checks for whether the particular cloud configuration exists in aai, if not exists returns 404.  If we are able to get, then the tenant's name derived from aai is set as tenantName.

    d) serviceInstanceName is derived from requestInfo.instanceName and is set.

    e) Request json is also set as RequestBody of InfraActiveRequests.

# 5. Checks fro whether duplicate name exists.

    a. version v[integer] is converted to the particular integer and stored.

    b. Checks whether instance name already exists in with a POST request in **http://request-db-adapter:8083/infraActiveRequests/checkInstanceNameDuplicate**, with the data { instanceIdmap = null, instanceName = {instanceName} , instanceservice = service } . It checks for the current progress and if in progress it throws the particular status.

# 6. Gets the orchestration url from the recipe table.

    a. Checks whether the service already exists in catalogdb **http://catalog-db-adapter:8082/service/{modelNameVersionId}** (GET).

    b. Checks the service recipe table with the modelNameVersionId and the action to be performed **http://catalog-db-adapter:8082/serviceRecipe/search/findFirstByServiceModelUUIDAndAction?serviceModelUUID={modelNameVersionId}&action=createInstance** . Returns a 404 if no recipe exists with the corresponding id.

    c. As recipe corresponding to this doesn't exist, we try to get with a default value. This flow comes under generic resource flow so the default value is GR-API-DEFAULT. First we get service with this value **http://catalog-db-adapter:8082/service/search/findFirstByModelNameOrderByModelVersionDesc?modelName=GR-API-DEFAULT** (GET). It returns a service with modelUUID as d88da85c-d9e8-4f73-b837-3a72a431622b, and further can be used to get the recipe.

    d. **http://catalog-db-adapter:8082/serviceRecipe/search/findFirstByServiceModelUUIDAndAction?serviceModelUUID=d88da85c-d9e8-4f73-b837-3a72a431622b&action=createInstance** (GET), gives a recipe which has a parameter "orchestrationUri" as "/mso/async/services/WorkflowActionBB".

# 7. Updates the infraActiveRequests with the current request.

    a) **http://request-db-adapter:8083/infraActiveRequests/** (POST) with the data formed. And a 201 created response is received.

# 8. Call the bpmn with a post call on orchestrationUri. The data to bpmn is
prepared having parameters like

    a) bpmnRequest - formed from input request.

    b) vfModuleId, pnfCorrelationId, networkId, configurationId, vfModuleType,
       serviceInstanceId , serviceType are updated if present in the input json
       or else set to empty string.

    c) apiVersion , requestId, aLaCarte = false (def), recipeTimeout = 180(def)
       ,requestAction= createInstance are all updated accordingly.

    d) requestUri - v7/serviceInstances ,which is formed from the request url.

# 9. A sync response is obtained on reaching bpmn like

     {"requestReferences":{"requestId":"c45702f7-3f08-4081-bc98-2f9f18b81607","instanceId":"cadca18f-9bff-44be-8910-ad29d342e91f","requestSelfLink":**"http://159.138.57.166:30277/orchestrationRequests/v7/c45702f7-3f08-4081-bc98-2f9f18b81607"**}}.


# 10. Calls the WorkflowActionBB.bpmn

# 10.1. RetrieveBBExecutionList - implemented in selectExecutionList in
WorkflowAction.java

    a. resourcetype, resourceid are formed from matching the requestUri to a
       regex pattern matcher

     .. code-block:: bash

        [pattern=[vV]\d+.*?(?:(?:/(?<type>vnfs|vfModules|networks|networkCollections|volumeGroups|serviceInstances|instanceGroups)(?:/(?<id>[^/]+))?)(?:/(?<action>[^/]+))?(?:/resume)?)] .

    b. Checks whether there is a service subscription with service instance name as {instanceName} correspoding to the customer in aai

        .. code-block:: bash

            https://aai.onap:8443/aai/v19/business/customers/customer/slice1/service-subscriptions/service-subscription/service/service-instances?depth=2&resultIndex=0&resultSize=1&service-instance-name={instanceName}.

        Returns 404 not found, if it doesnt exists then the id of that particular instance is taken and given as both the resourceid and serviceinstance id. If not present then a random value is generated, and is assigned same to both.

    c. Checks whether there is a service of the particular serviceInstanceId exists in aai. **https://aai.onap:8443/aai/v19/nodes/service-instances/service-instance/{serviceInstanceId}** , returns not found if it doesnt exist. If service with corresponding instance name already exists , then flowsToExecute is got by quering the requestdbadapter with the earlier request id.  If not present, then only orchestrationflows are got, and later from that the flowsToExecute are found out.

    d. Get the particular service from catalogdb . **http://so-catalog-db-adapter.onap:8082/service/{modelNameVersionId}**  (GET). Be sure that the service with this particular modelNameVersionId exists in catalogdb, because based on the services (like whether pnf, or vnf, or networkcollection) present in that particular service, which all bbs to execute are decided.

    e. This being a service, "service" is added to the resource list. And is checked upon for other resources like vnf and   network, eg:

        **http://so-catalog-db-adapter.onap:8082/service/{modelNameVersionId}/vnfCustomizations** (GET)

        **http://so-catalog-db-adapter.onap:8082/service/{modelNameVersionId}/collectionResourceCustomizations** (GET)

        **http://so-catalog-db-adapter.onap:8082/service/{modelNameVersionId}/networkCustomizations** (GET)

        And depending on the resources in the service, the resources found is updated like

        Found :Service - 1    Vnf - 0    Pnf - 0    VfModule - 0    VolumeGroup - 0    Network - 0    VirtualLink - 0    NetworkCollection - 0    Configuration - 0    InstanceGroup - 0

    f. Then the orchestration flows are get from the orchestration_flow_table depending on the cloudowner and request scope:

        **http://so-catalog-db-adapter.onap:8082/northbound_request_ref_lookup/search/findOneByActionAndRequestScopeAndIsAlacarteAndCloudOwnerAndServiceType?action=createInstance&requestScope=Service&isALaCarte=false&cloudOwner={CloudOwner}&serviceType=%2A** (GET)

        Here if present, then the orchestration flows are returned or else with default cloud owner, we try again

        **http://so-catalog-db-adapter.onap:8082/northbound_request_ref_lookup/search/findOneByActionAndRequestScopeAndIsAlacarteAndCloudOwnerAndServiceType?action=createInstance&requestScope=Service&isALaCarte=false&cloudOwner=DEFAULT&serviceType=%2A** (GET)

        Here in northBoundRequest is returned which has the parameter orchestrationFlowList, that contains the link that will return the orchestration flows.

        "orchestrationFlowList" : { "href" : "**http://so-catalog-db-adapter.onap:8082/northbound_request_ref_lookup/101/orchestrationFlowList**"}

        Now we do a get on the orchestration flow link to get the set of orchestration flows required

        **http://so-catalog-db-adapter.onap:8082/northbound_request_ref_lookup/101/orchestrationFlowList**.

        Here a set of 20 orchestration flows are returned under the action of Service-Macro-Create, each with a sequence no assigned sequentially in the given order

        * AssignServiceInstanceBB,
        * CreateNetworkCollectionBB,
        * AssignNetworkBB,
        * AssignVnfBB,
        * AssignVolumeGroupBB,
        * AssignVfModuleBB,
        * ConfigAssignVnfBB,
        * AssignPnfBB,
        * WaitForPnfReadyBB,
        * ActivatePnfBB,
        * CreateNetworkBB,
        * ActivateNetworkBB,
        * CreateVolumeGroupBB,
        * ActivateVolumeGroupBB,
        * CreateVfModuleBB,
        * ActivateVfModuleBB,
        * ConfigDeployVnfBB,
        * ActivateVnfBB,
        * ActivateNetworkCollectionBB,
        * ActivateServiceInstanceBB.


        .. image:: ../images/flowchart.png


    g. Flows to execute is determined by iterating through all the orchestartion flows and matching it with the found resources. It is merely a contains matching. In this particular as service was the only resource : List of BuildingBlocks to execute:AssignServiceInstanceBB, ActivateServiceInstanceBB.

    h. processing data is added to the requestdbadapter. Here the data is post to the requestdb as two different building blocks **http://so-request-db-adapter.onap:8083/requestProcessingData**.

    i. The already stored request details in request db is ammended like "lastModifiedBy" : "CamundaBPMN" , and status to in_progress with a put request.


# 10.2. sendSyncAck -  This was used to give an acknowledgement , with status
code as 200, and requestId and resourceId is sent as content.


# 10.3. Prevalidate the workflow


# 10.4. SelectBB - implemented in selectBBin WorkflowActionBBTasks

    This is used to select the building block from the flows to execute
    depending on the sequence order.

     a. Depending on the current sequence , the building block is selected from
        the flows to execute.

     b. Execution variable, that is passed between the different building
        blocks as the payload is amended as:
        execution.setVariable("buildingBlock", buildingblockselected).

     c. current sequence is incremented by 1, and updated in execution
        variable.

     d. Depending on whether currentSequence is greater than
        flowsToExecute.size(), COMPLETED variable is either set to true
        or false.

# 10.5. updateFlowStatistics - implemented in updateFlowStatistics in
WorkflowActionBBTasks

    a. Depending on the current sequence no, the completed bb and next bb is
       got from the flows to execute. And these are mentioned in a
       statusMessage.

    b. Percentage progress is got from the total no of bbs

    c. These are ammended to the already present request in the request db


# 10.6. Execute BB - calls the ExecuteBuildingBlock.bpmn

.. image:: ../images/ExecuteBuildingBlock.png

# 10.6.1. BBInputSetup - implemented in execute in BBInputSetup

    Here a generalbuildingblock is formed from executingbuildingblock after
    certain updations and validations.

     a. lookupKeyMap is formed from the input , and a map is formed with
        serviceInstanceId, networkID, vnfID, pnfID, vfmoduleID, volumegroupID,
        configurationID, instancegroupID as the keys.

     b. Depending on whether a la carte or macro , different flows are called.
        getGBBMacro is called in here.

     c. In getGBBMacro , a valid customer is got with service subscription.
        (getCustomerAndServiceSubscription)

        First a customer is got by get request on **https://aai.onap:8443/aai/v19/business/customers/customer/{globalSubscriberId}**

        After that ServiceSubscription is got by doing a get request

        **https://aai.onap:8443/aai/v19/business/customers/customer/{globalSubscriberId}/service-subscriptions/service-subscription/service**

        If, the above request doesnt give any , then ServiceSubscription is
        fetched by first creating uri keys

        **https://aai.onap:8443/aai/v19/nodes/service-instances/service-instance/{resourceId}?format=pathed**.

        Then ServiceSubscription is got from the globalSubscriberId and the
        uri keys

        .. note:: a valid customer and a corresponding ServiceSubscription must
            be present in the aai, for setting up the customer to gbuildingblock

     d. project and owningEntity is updated from the input

     e. service is got from the catalog db either by ModelVersionId or by ModelVersion and ModelInvariantId.

     f. ServiceInstance is created from the above parameters, and this ServiceInstance is used in the preparation of general building block.

     g. Depending on whether the current executing block name contains either of the network, or configuration, or network collection. A new instance of the corresponding type is created and is updated to the general building block (Happens in getGBBMacroNoUserParamsCreate)

     h. This general building block is set to the gBuildingBlockExecution and gBBInput parameter of execution.


# 10.6.2. StatusPolicy - implemented in validateOrchestrationStatus in
OrchestrationStatusValidator. Input being gBuildingBlockExecution

     a. orchestrationStatus is obtained after checking the resource type. We
        had updated the orchestrationStatus in the above step when a new
        service instance was created.

     b. OrchestrationStatusStateTransitionDirective is got by doing a get call
        to the catlog db with the url as
        findOneByResourceTypeAndOrchestrationStatusAndTargetAction

        **http://so-catalog-db-adapter.onap:8082/orchestrationStatusStateTransitionDirective/search/findOneByResourceTypeAndOrchestrationStatusAndTargetAction?resourceType=SERVICE&orchestrationStatus=PRECREATED&targetAction=ASSIGN**

    c. orchestrationStatusValidationResult parameter is set to
       executionvariable from the
       OrchestrationStatusStateTransitionDirective.getFlowDirective()
       "flowDirective" : "CONTINUE"

# 10.6.3. Prevalidate the gBuildingBlockExecution

# 10.6.4. BB To Execute: Depending on which building block is to be executed,
that particular bpmn is called .In this case, AssignServiceInstanceBB is called

    This block comes into play only if the handlingCode is retry, and the retry
    count is lesser than the maximum allowed no of retries, then the current
    sequence is again reduced by 1 , so that the same block is executed again.
    Request in the requestdb is updated with a setRetryStatusMessage,
    keeping an eye on the no of retries executed.


    And in this particular example ActivateServiceInstanceBB.
    bpmn is called next in the sequence.

    Here updateOrchestrationStatusActiveService is called, which is BPMN access
    method to update status of Service to Active in AAI.
    Here orchestrationStatus is set to active for the particular
    service instance and is updated in the AAI .

# 10.8. updateRequestStatusToComplete is called if the "complete" flag is true

     a. Here first the request is got from the requestDbclient **http://request-db-adapter:8083/infraActiveRequests/requestid**

     b. Then a status message is formed as "Macro-" + resourceName + "-"
        + action + " request was executed correctly."

       This status message is updated in the request as well as is set to
       finalStatusMessage of the execution variable

     c. Other request parameters are updated

          request.setEndTime(endTime);

          request.setFlowStatus("Successfully completed all Building Blocks");

          request.setProgress(Long.valueOf(100));

          request.setRequestStatus("COMPLETE");

          request.setLastModifiedBy("CamundaBPMN");

     d. This new request parameters are updated by a put request to the
        requestDbclient




Flow ends
----------

If there are other resources present along with the service : Eg
:- Volumegroup.( These BBs wil be specifically called )

1) AssignVolumeGroupBB :

     a. genericvnfid and volumegroupid is obtained from the execution block.
     b. volumegroup orchestrationstatus is set to assigned
     c. a volume group of the above details is created in aai
     d. connect volumegroup to this genericvnf
     e. cloud configuration is got,
        and then the volumegroup is linked to tenant

2) createVolumeGroupBB :

     a. get the vf details according to Vf module id from sdnc.
     b. vfmodulequeriedfromsdnc is set to the executionvariable.
     c. createVolumeGroupRequest is formed with getCloudRegion,
        serviceinstance, genericVnf, volumegroup, sdncVfModuleQueryResponse.
     d. calls vnfadapter, which in turn calls openstackadaptertask.
     e. update heattask in the volumegroup and which is ammended in the aai.
     f. orchestrationstatus for the volume group is set to created.

3) ActivateVolumeGroupBB :

     orchestrationstatus for the volume group is ammended to active.

Rollback, Retry and abort
------------------------------------

When exception is thrown then **Error handling**  event subprocess in BPMN
**ExecuteBuildingBlock** is invoked.

    .. image:: ../images/handling_error.png

    **QueryRainyDayTable task** main responsibility is to determine with
    **rainy_day_handler_macro** table the right policy to apply in order to
    recover from error.

    For each BB a policy is defined in **rainy_day_handler_macro** table
    (retry, rollback, abort ...)

    **HandlingCode** parameter is populated with  BB **policy** value.



# 1. In case of retry handling code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Policy in **rainy_day_handler_macro** table for current BB failure is **Retry**

.. image:: ../images/retry_Bdd2.png

Once Error handling subprocess has set handlingCode to **retry** value,
the main process retries to execute previous failing BB (green arrow).

.. image:: ../images/retry.png

If a new failure occurred a **new retry** is performed
(green arrow in Error handling subprocess)

.. image:: ../images/retry3.png


Until **max retry count** is reached, this time **secondary policy**
will be queried.

.. image:: ../images/retry2.png

**HandlingCode** is now set with  **secondary policy** value from
rainy_day_handler_macro table (rollback, abort...)

.. image:: ../images/retry_Bdd.png


# 2. In case of rollback handling code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Policy in **rainy_day_handler_macro** table for current BB failure is set to
**Rollback** (or RollbackToXXX)


    .. image:: ../images/rollback_Bdd.png

In case of Rollback the main process follows green arrows

    .. image:: ../images/rollback.png

    1) **HandlingCode** set previously in Error handling subprocess to Rollback
       (or RollbackToXXX) drives to **RollBack Execution Path** in main process

    2) **RollBack Execution Path** task has responsibility to prepare rollback
       flow sequence.

        BB FlowName are changed in the following way:

        * AssignXXX => UnassignXXX
        * CreateXXX => DeleteXXX
        * ActivateXXX => DeactivateXXX
        * AddXXX => DeleteXXX
        * VNFSetXXX => VNFUnsetXXX
        * VNFLockXXX => VNFUnLockXXX
        * VNFStopXXX => VNFStartXXX
        * VNFQuiesceXXX => VNFResumeXXX

    3) and 4.   **Loop** on step **3** and step **4**,  BB are executed one after one in order to **rollback** previous flow execution.

    5) RollBack completed.


# 3. In case of Abort handling code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Policy in **rainy_day_handler_macro** table for current BB failure is **Abort**

.. image:: ../images/abort.png



Suppress Rollback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Request can disable rollback with **suppressRollback** parameter

if **suppressRollback** is set to false value, **QueryRainyDayTable task**
will directly return abort without querying policy in table
**rainy_day_handler_macro**
