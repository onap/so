The Camunda_Modeler_ is the editor for BPMN 2.0 process flows.  It is a standalone application.  NOTE: the Camunda eclipse plugin is no longer supported and should not be used.

Modeler Templates
------------------

Some work has already been done in MSO to develop templates_ for "building block" subprocess flows.  When a template is provided for a BPMN element, the modeler displays a custom form for inputting parameters.  This significantly simplifies flow construction and reduces the chance of making mistakes.
