Download the latest Java_8_SE_Development_Kit_ from Oracle.   Select a Linux x64 package.

Unpack it.

Maven
------

Download the Apache_Maven_3.3.9_ binary.  NOTE: 3.3.9 is the recommended version, even though much higher versions are available.

Unpack it.

.. _Apache_Maven_3.3.9: https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.3.9/binaries/

Create an .m2 directory for maven and put settings.xml_ in it.  Edit the local repository path in settings.xml to make it correct for your environment.  Everything else should be OK.
