Version: 1.1.1

:Release Date: 2017-11-16


**New Features**

The SO provides the highest level of service orchestration in the ONAP architecture.
It executes end-to-end service activities by processing workflows and business logic and coordinating other ONAP and external component activities. 

The orchestration engine is a reusable service. Any component of the architecture can execute SO orchestration capabilities. 

* Orchestration services will process workflows based on defined models and recipe. 
* The service model maintains consistency and re-usability across all orchestration activities and ensures consistent methods, structure and version of the workflow execution environment.
* Orchestration processes interact with other platform components or external systems via standard and well-defined APIs.


**Deprecation Notes**

There is a MSO 1.0.0 SO implementation existing in the pre-R1 ONAP Gerrit system.  
The MSO1.0.0 is deprecated by the R1 release and the current release is built over this release.
The Gerrit repos of mso/* are voided and already locked as read-only.
Following are the deprecated SO projects in gerrit repo:

- mso
- mso/chef-repo
