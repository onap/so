This method shall follow the provisions specified in the Tables 6.4.15.3.1-1 and 6.4.15.3.1-2 for URI query parameters, request and response data structures, and response codes. Before returning the \"202 Accepted\" response, the NFVO shall update the \"isCancelPending\" and \"cancelMode\" attributes in the representation of the parent resource according to the provisions in clause 6.5.2.3. In case of success of processing the asynchronous request: 1) If the request has been processed in \"PROCESSING\" or \"ROLLING_BACK\" state, the \"operationState\" attribute in the representation of the parent resource shall be changed to \"FAILED_TEMP\". In both cases, the NFVO shall update the \"isCancelPending\" and \"cancelMode\" attributes in the representation of the parent resource according to the provisions in clause 6.5.2.3 to reflect the new status, and the applicable \"result\" notification according to clause 6.6.2.2 shall be emitted to indicate that the execution of the underlying NS LCM operation occurrence has temporarily failed. Due to race conditions, the processing of the actual operation that is to be cancelled may eventually still succeed, in which case the \"operationState\" attribute in the representation of the parent resource shall represent the result of that operation, rather than the result of the cancellation.\n",

This method shall support the URI query parameters, request and response data structures, and response codes, as specified in the Tables 6.4.16.3.1-1 and 6.4.16.3.1-2. Creation of two subscription resources with the same callbackURI and the same filter can result in performance degradation and will provide duplicates of notifications to the OSS, and might make sense only in very rare use cases. Consequently, the NFVO may either allow creating a subscription resource if another subscription resource with the same filter and callbackUri already exists (in which case it shall return the \"201 Created\" response code), or may decide to not create a duplicate subscription resource (in which case it shall return a \"303 See Other\" response code referencing the existing subscription resource with the same filter and callbackUri).\n",
